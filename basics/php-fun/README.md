# PHP Fun

## Files and Folders:

####  functions

This directory contains all of the functions that you'll need to implement. This is where you'll do most of your coding.

#### tests

The directory that contains all of the unit tests. You don't need to change any of these files, but feel free to take a look at the test code.

#### composer.json

Kind of like package.json with npm, but it's for `composer` instead. (composer is kind of like npm for php)

#### index.php

A php file that serves up some HTML. Use this file to include any of the function files and display the result in HTML. There's already an example in there.
